* unless stated lets just use 1 standard decks worth of cards without the cut card since we wont have that odd history table for analyzing

* starting from the player deal 2 to player and banker then player then banker

** Rules followed are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccarat
** details:
    - suits 10 or rather 0
    - number cards are used face value with Ace being 1
    - hands are modulo 10 which means the highest score you can get is 9

* player rule
    - if the player has an initial total of 5 or less then get another card
    - if player total is 6 or 7 then stand
    - if the player has a total of 8 or 9 at the start then its autowin for the player unless the banker also has 8 or 9

* banker rule
    - if the player has only 2 cards then its the same rules as the player
    - else:
    total 0 to 2 - draw a third card
    total 3 - draw a card unless players third card is an 8
    total 4 - draw a card if players third card is 2,3,4,5,6 or 7
    total 5 - draw a card if players third card is 4,5,6 or 7
    total 6 - draw a card if players third card is 6,7
    total 7 to 9 - stand
