# Simple Baccarat Game

**Coded up with:**
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [PIXI js v8](https://pixijs.com/)
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)
- [Assets by Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets)


**How to run:**
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
I will also include the dist folder so you can just go there and run [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or copy it into whatever you want to use to serve it.

You can also just generate the dist using:
```
npm run build
```
